    <h1>Benefits of Getting Involved</h1>
        <p>Getting involved comes with a variety of benefits. You   will get something out of the time and energy you put into any involvement opportunitiy/experience.</p>
    <h2>Skill Development</h2>
        <p>Anything you get involved in gives you the opportunity to develop all kinds of skills. Whether it is public speaking, time management, collaboration, critical thinking, or intrapersonal development, you have something to gain from getting involved. By scheduling a consultation with an Involvement Ambassador, they can help you identify some specific skills when refining your resume and reflecting on your involvement.</p>
    <h2>Sense of Belonging</h2>
        <p>Another key part of getting involved is feeling a sense of belonging. Involvement often comes with unique communities of people who begin to feel like home. Feeling like you belong is integral to helping students truly thrive in their environment, feel comfortable, take risks, and more easily learn and grow. What are your values? What makes a place feel like home to you? Consider looking for those at Mizzou or creating your own space on campus. Other students are bound to have similar interests, passions, and values.</p>
    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>Remember those skills everyone gains from getting involved? Well those connect to your professional skills and development too. By getting involved, students tend to inherently develop hard and soft skills that are essential in and outside of the workplace. Students can use involvement to gain experience in their major. There are many benefits to getting involved and outcomes that you can have. Consider being intentional about where you spend your time and energy during your journey at Mizzou.</p>

    <h2>The Columns of Student Learning and Development</h2>
        <p>Another part of Involvement Consultations with an Involvement Ambassador, Mizzou has created the Columns of Student Learning and Development. These are outcomes the university hopes students will develop and ebenfit from during their time at Mizzou. Think of these as large umbrella terms thast encompass tons of skills within them. The columns include skills related to <em>Interpersonal Development, Practical Competence, Knowledge Integration, Civic Engagement, Intrapersonal Development and Critical Thinking</em>.</p>
