  <h1>Resources to Get Involved at Mizzou</h1>
        <p></p>

    <h2><a href="https://getinvolved.missouri.edu/involvement-consultations/meet-the-ambassadors/" target="_blank">Involvement Ambassadors</a></h2>
        <p><a href="https://getinvolved.missouri.edu/involvement-consultations/" target="_blank">The Involvement Ambassadors are students at Mizzou who help fellow Tigers find a sense of belonging through involvement, in one-one consultations and group presentations.<a/>They also send out a <a href="https://us20.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=196d89cad9915a574b3cb7219&id=7ee7af1455" target="_blank">monthly newsletter with involvement opportunities on and off campus<a/> and host the Get Involved Fair each semester. To find the Involvement Ambassadors, visit the Center for Student Involvement (CSI) on the second floor of the Student Center. While you're there, you can also check out some studnt organizations! Many have their own spaces in the CSI.</p>

    <h2>Biannual and Annual Events</h2>
        <p>Some events that occur once or twice a year are also great opportunities to get invovled â€“ on and off campus.</p>
        <!--Consider breaking up these events for fall v. spring-->
      <h3>Get Involved Fair</h3>
          <p>The Get Involved Fair happens toward the beginning of the fall ands spring semester each year. Students can meet with student organziation representatives to learn more about many clubs and organizations at once at the fair. Free stuff is known to also be given away! Attending the Get Involved Fair helps students meet new people, learn more abotu what may interest them, and get information about who the people are along with details about meetings and events.</p>
      <h3>Caring for Columbia</h3>
          <p>An annual service event, Caring for Columbia, gives Mizzou students the opportunity to serve the local community. You can sign up to serve as an individual, group, student club or organization.</p>
      <h3>Summer Events</h3>
          <p>A variety of events happen throughout the summer too. First Friday, for example, is an event that occurs in Downtown Columbia the first Friday of each month. However, there are so many events in and around Columbia that you can attend in the summer. The summer is also a nice time to explore Columbia. Check out local trails, parks, restuarants, wineries and more in the summer!</p>
      <h3>Career Fairs</h3>
          <p>Career fairs are another neat opportunity to get invovled on campus. At multiple times throughout the year, employers visit Mizzou or host virtual meetings with students. Career fairs are a great way to find job and internship opportunities, and to just meet new people. You can always make connections even if you don't pursue every opportunity.</p>

    <h2>Local Involvement in CoMo</h2>
        <p>The University of Missouri may be located in Columbia, but there is so much more to the city. There are ample involvement opportunities in Columbia to consider too. Checking out events on <a href="https://www.visitcolumbiamo.com/events/" target="_blank">Visit Columbia, MO</a> or even <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/mo--columbia/events/" target="_blank">Event Brite</a> will have more involvement opportunities too.

    <h2>Social Media, GroupMe, etc.</h2>
          <p>After getting involved or while you adjust to life at Mizzou, you are bound to join a GroupMe or two, or connect with people via social media. This is another way to learn about involvement opportunities on and off campus. Whether it is a community service event, local festival, organization event, or a party, you can find more opportunities to stay involved on campus from social media too.</p>

    <h2>MU Engage</h2>
          <p>Although Mizzou will soon be upgrading to a new platform, <a href="https://missouri.campuslabs.com/engage/" target="_blank">MU Engage is a go-to place to find organizations and events on campus.</a>You can tailor your search to identify clubs, organizations, and events that align with your specific interests (such as the arts, service, greek life, etc.) MU Engage is also nice because it includes the contact information and a brief description of many student organizations. It's kind of like Google for Mizzou organizations and events. It's pretty cool.</p>
