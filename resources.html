    <h2>Local Involvement in Columbia</h2>
        <p>Columbia is a cool city. There are ample involvement opportunities in Columbia to consider to branch outside of the Mizzou bubble. Checking out events on <a href="https://www.visitcolumbiamo.com/events/" target="_blank">Visit Columbia, MO</a> or even <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/mo--columbia/events/" target="_blank">Event Brite</a> will have more ways to get involved in the community.</p>

        <br>

    <h2>Service @ Mizzou</h2>
      <p>Many service-based opportunities and organizations are also great ways to serve the community – <em>and</em> meet new people, bond with your friends, and make memories to last beyond your time at Mizzou.

    <h2><a href="https://getinvolved.missouri.edu/student-organizations/manage-an-org/resources/" target="_blank">The Organizastion Resource Group (ORG)</a></h2>
        <p>If you want to start your own student organization, it is possible! ORG is a helpful resource for getting started and will remain a key contact throughout the process. ORG is also a resource to current organizations.

    <h2>Social Media</h2>
          <p>After getting involved or while you adjust to life at Mizzou, you are bound to join a GroupMe or two, or connect with people via social media. This is another way to learn about involvement opportunities on and off campus. Whether it is a community service event, local festival, organization event, or a party, you can find more opportunities to stay involved on campus from social media too.</p>

          <br>

    <h2>MU Engage</h2>
          <p>Although Mizzou will soon be upgrading to a new platform, <a href="https://missouri.campuslabs.com/engage/" target="_blank">MU Engage is a go-to place to find organizations and events on campus.</a>You can tailor your search to identify clubs, organizations, and events that align with your specific interests (such as the arts, service, greek life, etc.) MU Engage is also nice because it includes the contact information and a brief description of many student organizations. It's kind of like Google for Mizzou organizations and events. It's pretty cool.</p>
