    <h1>Getting Involved with Your Major</h1>

        <p>You can also get involved in things related to your major. Many degree programs have webpages dedicated to involvement opportunities related to what students study. Included below are some of these webpages for different programs on campus. However, not every program has a pasge dedicated to involvement. If you were like me and exploring majors, that's awesome! Involvement can help you identify what you may want to study. Many times, you also do not have to be a specific major to join student organziations in various Mizzou degree programs. <a href="https://career.missouri.edu/" target="_blank">The Career Center</a> is also a resource to use to explore majors (and to keep utilizing throughout your time at Mizzou too)!</p>
